**<ins> Summary </ins>**

This repository is composed of mini projects submitted by me to the Quantum Computing Bootcamp at the Erdős Institute during the summer of 2025. The projects were proposed by the instructor Dr. Ákos Nagy. 

**<ins> Project #1:</ins>** This project is about implementations of a multi-controlled $U$ gate, denoted by $C^n U$, for a general unitary matrix $U$ in $U(2).$ It includes a brief survey of several implementations and the Qiskit code for implementing $C^n U$ for general $n$.
