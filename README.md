**<ins> Summary </ins>**

This project is about implementations of a multi-controlled $U$ gate, denoted by $C^n U$, for a general unitary matrix $U$ in $U(2).$ It also includes a survey of several implementations and the Qiskit code for implementing $C^n U$ for general $n$. 

This was a mini project that I completed during the Quantum Computing Bootcamp at [the Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) in summer 2025. The project was proposed by the course lead [Dr. Ákos Nagy](https://akosnagy.com/).
