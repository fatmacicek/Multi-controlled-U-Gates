This repository is composed of mini projects submitted by me to the Quantum Bootcamp at the Erdős Institute during the summer of 2025. The projects were proposed by the instructor Dr. Ákos Nagy. 

The first project is about implementations of a multi-controlled $U$ gate, denoted by $C^n U$, for a general unitary matrix $U$ in $U(2).$ It includes a brief survey of several implementations and the Qiskit code for
implementing $C^n U$ for general $n$.
