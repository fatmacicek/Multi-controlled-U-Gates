**<ins> Summary </ins>**

This repository is composed of mini projects submitted by me to the Quantum Computing Bootcamp at [the Erdős Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) during the summer of 2025. The projects were proposed by the course lead [Dr. Ákos Nagy](https://akosnagy.com/). 

**<ins> Project #1:</ins>** This project is about implementations of a multi-controlled $U$ gate, denoted by $C^n U$, for a general unitary matrix $U$ in $U(2).$ It includes a brief survey of several implementations and the Qiskit code for implementing $C^n U$ for general $n$.
