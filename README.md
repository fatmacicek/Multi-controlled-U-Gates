This repository is composed of mini projects submitted by me to the Quantum Bootcamp at the Erdős Institute during the summer of 2025. 

The first project is about implementations of a multi-controlled $U$ gate, denoted by $C^n U$, for a general unitary matrix $U$ in $U(2).$ It includes a brief survey of several implementations and the Qiskit code for
implementing $C^n U$ for general $n$.
